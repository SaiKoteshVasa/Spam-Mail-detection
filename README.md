# Spam Mail Detection Using Random Forest Classifier
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting spam emails using a Random Forest Classifier. The project involves training a machine learning model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

# Project Overview
Email spam detection is an essential task to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails. This project demonstrates the application of the Random Forest Classifier, a robust and ensemble learning algorithm, to identify spam emails based on their content and metadata.

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on a dataset of labeled emails.<br>

# Steps Included<br>
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature extraction.<br>
2. **Model Training**: Training the Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed dataset.<br>
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
4. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new emails as spam or ham.<br>

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

# Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying spam emails.
