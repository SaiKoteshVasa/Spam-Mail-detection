# Spam Mail Detection Using Random Forest Classifier
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting spam emails using a Random Forest Classifier. The project involves training a machine learning model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

# Project Overview
Email spam detection is an essential task to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails. This project demonstrates the application of the Random Forest Classifier, a robust and ensemble learning algorithm, to identify spam emails based on their content and metadata.

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on a dataset of labeled emails.

# Steps Included
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature extraction.
**Model Training**: Training the Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed dataset.
**Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
**Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new emails as spam or ham.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

# Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying spam emails.
